'''There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its
next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
