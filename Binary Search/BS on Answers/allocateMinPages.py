'''Given an array "arr of integer numbers, "ar[i]" represents the number of pages in the "i-th" book. 
There are a "m" number of students, and the task is to allocate all the books to the students.

Allocate books in such a way that:
Each student gets at least one book.
Each book should be allocated to only one student.
Book allocation should be in a contiguous manner.

You have to allocate the book to "m" students such that the maximum number of pages assigned to a student 
is minimum. If the allocation of books is not possible. return -1'''
